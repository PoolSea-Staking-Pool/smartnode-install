# Poolsea - Smart Node Installation

This repository contains compiled binaries for the [Poolsea smart node](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode) client, as well as the installation script & configuration assets for the smart node service.

The smart node client is supported on Linux, MacOS and Windows.
**Note that a smart node cannot be run locally on Windows at this stage; the Windows client can only be used to manage a remote server.**

The smart node service is supported on all Unix platforms, with automatic dependency installation for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.
A smart node can be run on other Unix platforms, but manual installation of dependencies ([docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)) is required.



## Smart Node Client Installation


### Linux (64 bit)

With cURL:
```
curl -L https://github.com/Seb369888/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-linux-amd64 --create-dirs -o ~/bin/rocketpool && chmod +x ~/bin/rocketpool
```

With wget:
```
mkdir -p ~/bin && wget https://github.com/Seb369888/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-linux-amd64 -O ~/bin/rocketpool && chmod +x ~/bin/rocketpool
```

**Note: you may need to start a new shell session before you can run the `poolsea` command.**


### MacOS Intel (64 bit)

With cURL:
```
curl -L https://github.com/Seb369888/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-darwin-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/rocketpool && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rocketpool
```

With wget:
```
wget https://github.com/Seb369888/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-darwin-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/rocketpool && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/rocketpool
```


### MacOS M1 (64 bit)

With cURL:
```
curl -L https://github.com/Seb369888/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-darwin-arm64 -o /opt/homebrew/bin/rocketpool && chmod +x /opt/homebrew/bin/rocketpool
```

With wget:
```
wget https://github.com/Seb369888/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-darwin-arm64 -O /opt/homebrew/bin/rocketpool && chmod +x /opt/homebrew/bin/rocketpool
```


### Windows (64 bit)

1. Download the [smart node client](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/rocketpool-cli-windows-amd64.exe).
2. Move it to the desired location on your system (e.g. `C:\bin\rocketpool.exe`).
3. Open the command prompt and run it via its full path (e.g. `C:\bin\rocketpool.exe`).



## Smart Node Service Installation


### Automatic

Once you have installed the Poolsea smart node client, simply run the `rocketpool service install` command to install the smart node service locally.

To install to a remote server, use:
```
rocketpool --host example.com --user username --key /path/to/identity.pem service install
```

If automatic dependency installation is not supported on your platform, use the `-d` option to skip this step (e.g. `rocketpool service install -d`).
Then, manually install [docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


### Manual

If you would prefer to check the installation script before running it, you may download and run it manually.

With cURL:
```
curl -L https://github.com/Seb369888/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/install.sh -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh
rm install.sh
```

With wget:
```
wget https://github.com/Seb369888/smartnode-install/releases/latest/download/install.sh -O install.sh
chmod +x install.sh

./install.sh
rm install.sh
```

The installation script prints progress messages to stdout and full command output to stderr.
Use `1>/dev/null` to silence progress messages, or `2>/dev/null` to silence command output.


### Available Options

The following options apply to both automatic and manual installation unless specified otherwise:

* `-r`: Verbose mode (print all output from the installation process) - automatic installation only
* `-d`: Skip automatic installation of OS dependencies
* `-n`: Specify a network to run the smart node on (default: pyrmont)
* `-v`: Specify a version of the smart node service package files to use (default: latest)


### Post-Install

Once the smart node service has been installed, you may need to start a new shell session if working locally.
This is required for updated user permissions to take effect (for interacting with docker engine).
